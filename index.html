      <h2> What is a seltzer and why does Happy Dad do it differently?</h2>
    </div>
      <div id="unorderedlist">
        <ul>
          <li class="list ">First of all, seltzer is not alcohol, but hard seltzers are carbonated sodas spiked to the alcohol level of a light beer. Hard seltzers are made by adding a little sugar to carbonated water, which is then fermented by introducing yeast so that the sugars are converted into alcohol. The alcohol content of most spiked seltzers falls in the range of 4-6% alcohol by volume (ABV). Some can be as high as 12% ABV, which is the same amount as the standard five-ounce serving of wine. Virtually any type of spirit or alcoholic beverage can be used to make hard seltzers.</li>
          <li>(Personal Opinion) There are a lot of different types of hard seltzers out there but Happy Dad Seltzers have a smooth rich taste, and when it comes to flavor, you can't beat there collaboration with Death Row Records on the Grape flavored happy dad!</li>
          <li>Another thing that makes Happy Dad's seltzers stand out are their "Big daddies", or tall cans if you must. The talls cans  take me back to my younger partying days where I could smell the bonfire smoke sticking to my clothes and leaving me reeking of burnt smoke for days. </li>
